Bar Managing System



What will the application do?

I am planning to design an application for bars to manage seating and billing.With this application users can customize table information based on the number and capacity of tables at their bars and create menus based on what they serve. Servers can check the availability of tables and the seating capacity of each table. With this information, servers can allocate customers to available tables efficiently, in which servers can register the group of customers into an available table and the availability of that table will automatically change and that table will carry the future order and bill information. Then, servers can use this application to take orders from each customer seated at the table by putting the order under the person who ordered it. For the payment phase, servers can choose to generate one bill with all the orders for all customers or generate individual bills for each customer.



Who will use it?

This user-friendly application will cater to servers working at bars, providing them with the tools needed to improve their workflow.



Why is this project of interest to you?

I am interested in designing this project because I always go to bars on weekends and I have a couple of friends working at bars, so I want to design an application for people working at bars to make their work easier and improve their efficiency.
